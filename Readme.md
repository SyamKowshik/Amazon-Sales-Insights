Project Summary: The project unfolds a visual exploration of Amazon sales data through meticulously designed Tableau dashboards. These dashboards encapsulate a detailed and dynamic representation of various facets of the sales dataset, offering a comprehensive view of trends, patterns, and essential performance indicators.

The significance of this topic lies in its ability to transform raw data into visually compelling insights. By leveraging the power of Tableau, the document not only provides a visual feast of graphs and charts but also serves as a strategic tool for decision-makers. It allows stakeholders to discern and analyze the intricacies of Amazon sales, ultimately aiding in the formulation of well-informed business strategies.

In a world inundated with data, the visual analytics presented in this document become a critical asset for unraveling the complexities of the Amazon sales landscape. The interactivity and dynamic nature of Tableau dashboards enhance the user experience, enabling users to delve deep into specific areas of interest, identify emerging trends, and extract actionable insights for optimizing business performance.

In exploring the topic of Amazon sales data through Tableau dashboards, I will focus on several key variables to gain a comprehensive understanding of the sales landscape. These variables include:

Sales Quantity by Category: Examining the distribution of sales quantities across different product categories to identify high-performing and underperforming segments.

Shipping Modes and Service Levels: Analyzing the statistics of shipping modes utilized across states based on the quantity of sales, providing insights into the effectiveness of various shipping strategies.

Amount by Category: Investigating the monetary value of sales categorized by different product categories, aiding in the identification of revenue-generating segments.

Top States with Respect to Quantity, Amount, and Shipping Service Level: Identifying and visualizing the states that exhibit high sales quantities and optimal shipping service levels, facilitating a targeted approach for improvement or optimization.

Shipped Status Analysis: Investigating the distribution of sales based on the "Shipped Status" variable to understand the percentage of orders that have been successfully shipped.

Shipping Modes and Service Levels in Relation to Shipped Status: Exploring how different shipping modes and service levels correlate with the "Shipped Status," providing insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the shipping process.

These variables will serve as focal points for the exploration, allowing for a nuanced analysis of Amazon sales data and enabling stakeholders to derive actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

Based on the story I want to tell. After doing several research I got so many questions, so I summed them up and came with following questions:

Question- 1: What are the Trending fashions to Improve sales on over all states and cities. This question will answer several questions like:

What are the top three clothing categories driving sales in each state?
Can we identify any trends in the quantity of purchases for clothing across states?
Question -2: Why do certain states exhibit a preference for specific shipping modes, and how does the quantity of sales, coupled with the product status, influence this preference? This question will answer several questions like:

What is the most utilized shipping mode in our top-performing states?
